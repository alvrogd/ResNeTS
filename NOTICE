This project implements multiple deep learning models for time series analysis.
Some of these models are reimplementations of works by other authors. The
publicly available code repositories of these works have been used as guidance
during the development of this project to ensure equivalent functionality. All
relevant references are provided where applicable.

The dataset used in this project is derived from public data available at the
repository of the Biodiversity Exploratories BExIS
(https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/); accession numbers 30969 (Sentinel-2 time
series) and 27386 (Species inventories). This data is used in compliance with
the terms of their respective licenses.
